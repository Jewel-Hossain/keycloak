## Outstanding Items

### ⚠️ Keycloak Synchronization
- **Issue**: "Account created but could not sync with Keycloak"
- **Cause**: Keycloak was still starting up when test ran
- **Impact**: User created in Foodi successfully, roles stored correctly
- **Resolution**: Manual resync available via Admin panel (Head users)
- **Note**: Will work on subsequent registrations when Keycloak is fully running

---

## Next Recommended Tests

1. **Register Admin User**:
   - Verify Admin can see "⚙️ Admin" menu item
   - Test Admin Dashboard access
   - Test User Management access (view only for Admin)

2. **Register Head User**:
   - Verify Head can see all menu items
   - Test User Management (full control)
   - Test role change functionality
   - Test user activation/deactivation

3. **Test Role Changes**:
   - Login as Head
   - Change testlead1 from Lead to Agent
   - Verify menu changes (Reports should disappear)

4. **Test Keycloak Sync**:
   - Wait for Keycloak to fully start
   - Register new user
   - Verify role appears in Keycloak Admin Console
   - Test manual resync for existing users
