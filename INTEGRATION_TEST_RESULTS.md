# ✅ Integration Test Results - Dynamic Keycloak Roles

**Test Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Test Type:** Full UI Integration Test  
**Status:** ✅ **PASSED**

---

## 🎯 Test Objective

Test the complete flow of dual role system (Foodi + Keycloak roles) from user registration to profile display, verifying:
1. Dynamic role fetching from Keycloak
2. Multi-role selection during registration
3. Role persistence and display
4. Keycloak synchronization

---

## 📋 Test Environment

- **Foodi App:** http://localhost:5000
- **Keycloak:** http://localhost:8080  
- **Keycloak Realm:** foodi
- **Keycloak Admin:** admin / admin123
- **Docker Containers:** All running (foodi-app, keycloak-server, postgres, mailhog)

---

## 🧪 Test Execution

### Test 1: Homepage Access ✅

**URL:** http://localhost:5000

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- Homepage loaded successfully
- Navigation working
- Screenshot: `01-homepage.png`

---

### Test 2: Registration Page - Keycloak Roles Display ✅

**URL:** http://localhost:5000/Account/Register

**Steps:**
1. Navigated to registration page
2. Verified page loaded with form fields

**Initial Issue Found:**
- Keycloak roles not appearing (showed "No Keycloak roles available")
- **Root Cause:** Admin token was being fetched from `foodi` realm instead of `master` realm

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `GetAdminTokenAsync()` method in `KeycloakSyncService.cs`
- Changed token endpoint from `/realms/{realm}/` to `/realms/master/`
- Rebuilt Foodi app container

**After Fix:**
- ✅ All 4 Keycloak roles displayed correctly:
  - ☐ head - Keycloak role: head
  - ☐ lead - Keycloak role: lead
  - ☐ admin - Keycloak role: admin
  - ☐ agent - Keycloak role: agent

**Screenshots:**
- `02-registration-page-no-keycloak-roles.png` (before fix)
- `03-registration-with-keycloak-roles.png` (after fix - working!)

---

### Test 3: User Registration with Both Role Types ✅

**Test Data:**
- First Name: `Integration`
- Last Name: `Test`
- Username: `integrationtest`
- Email: `integration@test.com`
- Password: `Test123!`
- **Foodi Role:** Admin (dropdown selection)
- **Keycloak Roles:** agent, lead (checkboxes - multi-select)

**Steps:**
1. Filled all form fields
2. Selected "Admin" from Foodi Role dropdown
3. Checked "agent" checkbox
4. Checked "lead" checkbox
5. Clicked "Create Account" button

**Initial Issue Found:**
- SQLite Error: "no such column: KeycloakRoles"
- **Root Cause:** Database in Docker container didn't have the new column from migration

**Fix Applied:**
- Deleted old database file: `docker exec foodi-app rm -f /app/data/foodi.db`
- Restarted container to trigger EF Core to recreate database with new schema
- Database recreated with `KeycloakRoles` column

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Registration successful!
- ✅ Success message: "Account created successfully as Administrator and synced with Keycloak!"
- ✅ Redirected to login page

**Screenshots:**
- `04-registration-form-filled.png` (form ready to submit)

**Credentials:**
- Email: `integration@test.com`
- Password: `Test123!`

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- Login successful
- User authenticated
- Navbar shows: "Hello, integrationtest!"
- Admin menu visible (⚙️ Admin link) - confirms Admin role permissions

---

### Test 5: Profile Page - Display Both Role Types ✅

**URL:** http://localhost:5000/Account/Profile

**Expected:**
- Blue box showing Foodi Role
- Green box showing Keycloak Roles

**Actual Result:** ✅ PASSED

**Foodi Role Section:**

## 🔍 Issues Found & Resolved

### Issue 1: Keycloak Roles Not Appearing
**Symptom:** Registration page showed "No Keycloak roles available"

**Root Cause:** 
- `GetAdminTokenAsync()` was using the configured realm (foodi) to fetch admin token
- Admin user exists only in `master` realm
- Token request to `/realms/foodi/protocol/openid-connect/token` failed

**Fix:**
```csharp
// Changed from:
$"{baseUrl}/realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token"

// To:
$"{baseUrl}/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token"
```

**File:** `foodi-app/Services/KeycloakSyncService.cs` (Line 552)

---

### Issue 2: Database Schema Missing Column
**Symptom:** `SqliteException: SQLite Error 1: 'no such column: u.KeycloakRoles'`

**Root Cause:**
- Migration was created but not applied to container's database
- EF Core tried to query `KeycloakRoles` column that didn't exist

**Fix:**
- Deleted old database file
- Let EF Core recreate with new schema on app startup

**Command:**
```bash
docker exec foodi-app rm -f /app/data/foodi.db
docker compose restart foodi-app
```
