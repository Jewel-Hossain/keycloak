## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Disabled Pre-Sync
**File:** `AccountController.cs` (line 69-72)
- Users no longer synced to Keycloak during registration
- Keycloak creates user on first SSO login
- Eliminates "account already exists" conflict

### Fix #2: ReturnUrl Hidden Input
**File:** `Login.cshtml` (line 17-21)
- Added hidden input to preserve returnUrl in POST
- OIDC authorization parameters now preserved
- User redirected back to complete OAuth flow

### Fix #3: ReturnUrl Validation
**File:** `AccountController.cs` (line 156-170)
- Improved validation to allow `/connect/` URLs
- Proper URL decoding
- Logging for debugging

### Fix #4: Post-Logout Redirect URIs
**File:** `Program.cs` (line 105-114)
- Added: `.../broker/foodi/endpoint/logout_response`
- Added multiple Keycloak endpoints
- Covers all logout scenarios

### Fix #5: Logout Endpoint
**File:** `AuthorizationController.cs` (line 195-211)
- Reads `post_logout_redirect_uri` from request
- Uses it if valid, falls back to "/" otherwise
- Proper OpenIddict SignOut

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Pre-sync causes conflicts** - Don't sync users before they use SSO
2. **ReturnUrl must be preserved** - Use hidden inputs in forms
3. **All redirect URIs must be registered** - Including logout variants
4. **Trust email simplifies flow** - No verification needed
5. **Docker networking matters** - Use service names for server-to-server

---

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Users

```bash
# 1. Start everything
docker compose up -d

# 2. Register in Foodi
http://localhost:5000

# 3. Test "Login with Foodi"
http://localhost:8080/realms/master/account
→ Click "Sign in"
→ Click "Login with Foodi"
→ Login with your Foodi credentials
→ ✅ Automatically logged into Keycloak!
```
